The file "stream.cpp" is the only souce file for the Delft-Stream library.
It support both TCP/IP and MPI mode, and contains both C and C++ MPI bindings.
The latter are MPI-2, and will prevail over the C bindings once MPI-2
becomes more widely implemented.

The file "stream-mpi.cpp" is a test/debug version that only supports MPI
and uses the MPI-1.2 C bindings.
